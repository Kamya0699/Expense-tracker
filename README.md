# Expense-tracker
It is a python based project that is used to keep the track of our day to day expenses including food, petrol, shopping, etc.
It has a few modules made individually for every aspect which are connected to each other. 
The gui is made using tkinter library in python. I have also tried to use linear regression in there. There is also a graphical representation of expenses in there.
It is connected to a database created using mysql with python. 
There are two databases formed here: one is for the login info and one is for adding the income and expenses in there
